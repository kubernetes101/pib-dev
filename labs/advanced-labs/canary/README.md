# PiB Automated Canary deployment using Flagger

## Introduction

[Flagger](https://flagger.app/) is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release process for applications running on Kubernetes. It takes a Kubernetes deployment and creates a series of objects (Kubernetes deployments, ClusterIP services and Contour HTTPProxy) for an application. These objects expose the application in the cluster and drive the canary analysis and promotion.

## Lab Prerequisites

- Complete outer-loop [Lab 1](../../outer-loop.md) and skip the [Delete Your Cluster](../../outer-loop.md#delete-your-cluster) section

## Validate cluster identifier and working branch

```bash

# make sure MY_CLUSTER is set from previous lab
echo $MY_CLUSTER

# make sure your branch is set and pushed remotely
# commands will fail if you are in main branch
git branch --show-current

```

## Install Flagger and Grafana

> Note: Grafana installation is optional. It provides visibility in to primary and canary workloads during canary analysis.

```bash

# make sure you are in the root directory
cd $PIB_BASE

# copy flagger and flagger-grafana to apps directory
cp -R ./labs/advanced-labs/canary/flagger apps
cp -R ./labs/advanced-labs/canary/flagger-grafana apps

# add and commit the flagger app
git add .
git commit -am "added flagger and grafana apps"
git push

cd apps/flagger

# check deploy targets (should be [])
flt targets list

# clear the targets if not []
# flt targets clear

# add all clusters as a target
flt targets add all

cd ../flagger-grafana

# check deploy targets (should be [])
flt targets list

# clear the targets if not []
# flt targets clear

# add all clusters as a target
flt targets add all

# deploy the changes
flt targets deploy

```

### Check that your GitHub Action is running

- <https://github.com/kubernetes101/pib-dev/actions>
  - your action should be queued or in-progress

### Check deployment

Once the action completes successfully you should see flagger added to your cluster

```bash

# pull the latest and force flux to sync
# flux will sync on a schedule - this command forces it to sync now for debugging
git pull
flt sync

# check that flagger is deployed to your cluster
# NOTE: We also deploy prometheus to scrape metrics to monitor Canary deployment
flt check app flagger
flt check app prometheus
flt check app flagger-grafana

```

## Update reference app to use Canary deployment Strategy

- Update IMDb reference app to use canary deployment template:

    ```bash

    cd $PIB_BASE

    # update imdb app.yaml with canary template
    sed -i 's,pib-service,pib-service-canary,g' apps/imdb/app.yaml

    # validate app.yaml
    cat apps/imdb/app.yaml

    # deploy imdb with canary template
    cd apps/imdb
    flt targets deploy

    ```

- Once the [github action](https://github.com/kubernetes101/pib-dev/actions) is completed, force flux to sync:

     ```bash

    # force flux to sync
    # flux will sync on a schedule - this command forces it to sync now for debugging
    git pull
    flt sync

    ```

- Validate primary and canary objects in the cluster:

    ```bash

    flt exec kic pods
    flt exec kic svc

    ```

    The reference app should be updated with Canary Deployment objects listed:

    ```bash

      deployment.apps/imdb
      deployment.apps/imdb-primary
      deployment.apps/webv-imdb
      service/imdb
      service/imdb-canary
      service/imdb-primary
      service/webv-imdb
      httpproxy.projectcontour.io/imdb

    ```


## Observe automated canary promotion

- Trigger a canary deployment by updating the container image for IMDb:

    ```bash

    # make sure you're in imdb dir
    cd $PIB_BASE/apps/imdb

    # Update imdb app.yaml with image tag from latest to beta
    sed -i 's,ghcr.io/cse-labs/pib-imdb:latest,ghcr.io/cse-labs/pib-imdb:beta,g' app.yaml

    # validate app.yaml
    cat app.yaml

    # deploy imdb with new image
    flt targets deploy

    ```

- Once the [github action](https://github.com/kubernetes101/pib-dev/actions) is completed, force flux to sync:

    ```bash

    # force flux to sync
    # flux will sync on a schedule - this command forces it to sync now for debugging
    git pull
    flt sync

    ```

- Observe canary promotion in k9s:

  ```bash

  # start k9s for the cluster
  flt ssh $MY_CLUSTER
  k9s <enter>

  ```

  - Type `:canaries <enter>` to view canary object
  - Observe `status` and `weight` for canary promotion

    > - Flagger detects the deployment version change and starts a new rollout with 20% traffic progression
    > - Once canary `status` is updated to `Succeeded`, 100% of the traffic should be routed to new version

  - Press `enter` again and scroll to bottom to see events
  - Press `escape` to go back
  - Exit K9s: `:q <enter>`
  - Exit from cluster: `exit <enter>`

- Observe canary analysis in Grafana:
  - Navigate to grafana dashboard by appending `/grafana` to the host url in the browser tab.
  - Grafana login info
    - admin
    - change-me
  - Navigate to `Envoy Canary` dashboard

## Observe automated rollback

- Trigger another canary deployment by updating the container image for IMDb:
  > NOTE: Image tag `pib-imdb:bad` is designed generate HTTP 500 errors to test if Flagger pauses the rollout

    ```bash

    # make sure you're in imdb dir
    cd $PIB_BASE/apps/imdb

    # Update imdb app.yaml with image tag from beta to bad
    sed -i 's,ghcr.io/cse-labs/pib-imdb:beta,ghcr.io/cse-labs/pib-imdb:bad,g' app.yaml

    # validate app.yaml
    cat app.yaml

    # deploy imdb with new image
    flt targets deploy

    ```

- Once the [github action](https://github.com/kubernetes101/pib-dev/actions) is completed, force flux to sync:

    ```bash

    # force flux to sync
    # flux will sync on a schedule - this command forces it to sync now for debugging
    git pull
    flt sync

    ```

- Observe canary promotion in k9s:

  ```bash

  # start k9s for the cluster
  flt ssh $MY_CLUSTER
  k9s <enter>

  ```

  - Type `:canaries <enter>` to view canary object
  - Observe `status` and `weight` for canary promotion

    > - Flagger detects the deployment version change and starts a new rollout with 20% traffic progression
    > - Once canary `status` is updated to `Succeeded`, 100% of the traffic should be routed to new version

  - Press `enter` again and scroll to bottom to see events
  - Press `escape` to go back
  - Exit K9s: `:q <enter>`
  - Exit from cluster: `exit <enter>`

- Observe canary analysis in Grafana:
