# Pilot-in-a-Box Overview

Kubernetes is hard. Getting started and set up for the first time can take weeks to get right. Managing deployments on a fleet of Kubernetes clusters on the edge brings even more challenges.

Pilot-in-a-Box (PiB) is a `game-changer` for the end-to-end Kubernetes app development cycle from a local cluster to deployments on the edge. It reduces the initial friction and empowers the developer to get started and deployed to a dev/test environment within *minutes*. The pre-configured Codespaces environment includes a `Kubernetes` cluster and custom CLI's (`kic` and `flt`) that help streamline the initial learning curve to Kubernetes development commands.

This repo walks through the rich end-to-end developer experience in a series of labs. The labs start by walking you through creating, building, testing, and deploying an application on a local cluster ([inner-loop](./README.md#inner-loop)) with a complete CNCF observability stack. Then, the labs move on to the next step of deploying the application to a test cluster in the Cloud ([outer-loop](./README.md#outer-loop)). There are also several [advanced labs](./README.md#advanced-labs) that cover centralized monitoring, canary deployments, and targeting different devices.

> Note: PiB is not intended as-is for production deployments. However, some concepts covered (GitOps and Observability) are production-ready.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Codespaces access
- An Azure subscription with owner access
  - A [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/) will work for exploration
  - Some advanced scenarios also require AAD permissions

## GitHub Codespaces

> Codespaces allows you to develop in a secure, configurable, and dedicated development environment in the cloud that works how and where you want it to

- [GitHub Codespaces Overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)
  - GitHub Codespaces is available for organizations using GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud. GitHub Codespaces is also available as a limited beta release for individual users on GitHub Pro plans.
  - For more information, see ["GitHub's products"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products)

We use GitHub Codespaces for our `inner-loop` and `outer-loop` Developer Experiences. While other DevX are available, currently, we only support GitHub Codespaces.

The easiest way to get GitHub Codespaces access is to setup a [GitHub Team](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)

GitHub Codespaces is also available in beta on a limited basis for GitHub Pro users. The waiting list is normally > 3 months.

> Best Practice: as you begin projects, ensure that you have Codespaces and Azure subscriptions with proper permissions

## inner-loop

- `inner-loop` refers to the tasks that developers do every day as part of their development process
  - Generally, `inner-loop` happens on the individual developer workstation
    - For PiB, the inner-loop and developer workstation is Codespaces
    - When a developer creates a Codespace, that is their "personal development workstation in the cloud"
- As part of PiB, we have automated the creation of the developer workstation using a repeatable, consistent, Infrastructure as Code approach
  - We have an advanced workshop planned for customizing the Codespaces experience for your project
- With the power of Codespaces, a developer can create a consistent workstation with a few clicks in less than a minute

## outer-loop

- `outer-loop` refers to the tasks that developers and DevOps do as they move from dev to test to pre-prod to production
  - Generally `outer-loop` happens on shared compute outside of the developer workstation
  - For PiB, outer-loop uses a combination of Codespaces and `dev/test clusters` in Azure
- As part of PiB, we have automated the creation of dev/test clusters using a repeatable, consistent, Infrastructure as Code approach

## Create a Codespace

> You can use the same Codespace for any of the labs

- From this repo
  - Click the `<> Code` button
    - Make sure the Codespaces tab is active
  - Click `Create Codespace on main`
- After about 1 minute, you will have a GitHub Codespace running with a complete Kubernetes Developer Experience!

## Create a working branch

- Because the main branch has a branch protection rule, you need to create a working branch
  - You can use the same branch for any of the labs or create a new branch per lab (add 1, 2, 3 ... to the branch name)

  ```bash

  # use lower case GitHub User Name as branch name
  export MY_BRANCH=$(echo $GITHUB_USER | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
  echo $MY_BRANCH

  # create a branch
  git checkout -b $MY_BRANCH

  # push the branch and set the remote
  git push -u origin $MY_BRANCH

  ```

- Your prompt should look like this
  - /workspaces/Pilot-in-a-Box (mybranch) $

## inner-loop Labs

- [Lab 1](./labs/inner-loop.md): Create, build, deploy, and test a new dotnet application and observability stack on your local cluster
- [Lab 2](./labs/inner-loop-flux.md): Configure flux to automate the deployment process from Lab 1

## outer-loop Labs

- [Lab 1](./labs/outer-loop.md): Create a dev/test cluster and manage application deployments on the cluster
- [Lab 2](./labs/outer-loop-multi-cluster.md): Manage application deployments on a fleet of multiple clusters
- [Lab 3](./labs/outer-loop-ring-deployment.md): Configure ring based deployments

- [Lab 4](./labs/azure-codespaces-setup.md): Set up Azure subscription and Codespaces for advanced configuration
  - This is a prerequisite for the Advanced Labs

## Advanced Labs

- [Arc enabled GitOps Lab](./labs/outer-loop-arc-gitops.md): Deploy to dev cluster running on an Azure VM with Arc enabled GitOps
- [Canary Deployment Lab](./labs/advanced-labs/canary/README.md): Use Flagger to experiment with canary deployments
- [Vision on Edge (VoE) Lab](./labs/advanced-labs/voe/README.md): Deploy a more complex app (VoE) to a fleet
- [Centralized Observability Lab](./labs/advanced-labs/monitoring/README.md): Deploy a centralized observability system with Fluent Bit, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor fleet application deployments
- [outer-loop with AKS-IoT](./labs/advanced-labs/aks-iot/README.md): Deploy to an AKS-IoT cluster running on an Azure VM with Arc enabled GitOps
- [outer-loop with AKS Lab](./labs/outer-loop-aks-azure.md): Deploy to an AKS cluster with Arc enabled GitOps

## Cleanup

- Once you are finished with all of the labs and experimenting, please delete your branch

  ```bash

  # change to the root of the repo
  cd $PIB_BASE

  git pull
  git add .
  git commit -am "deleting branch"
  git push

  # checkout main branch, delete remote, delete local
  git checkout main
  git push origin $MY_BRANCH --delete
  git branch -D $MY_BRANCH

  ```
